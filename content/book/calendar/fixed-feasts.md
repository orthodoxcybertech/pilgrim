Big list of all the days of the year, grouped by month, with new name and “hath X days.”, e.g.: Crossmonth hath 31 days. All the fixed Great Feasts highlighted bold, with fasts, forefeasts, afterfeasts, leavetakings, and paramonies marked; also some other significant commemorations highlighted but less so (e.g. Protection of the Godbirther); and still others less so (e.g. St Porphyrios); and for every day of the year the one or two most significant commemorations of saints.
