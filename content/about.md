**Pilgrim** is a website and app for (Eastern) Orthodox Christians who wish to pray in beautiful traditional English. It currently features a prayer book and bible compiled from various traditional English translations. A dynamic service compilation tool is in development, to be a fully-featured counterpart to liturgy.io and the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America's Digital Chant Stand.
