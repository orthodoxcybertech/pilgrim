## THE FIRST ANTIPHON, PSALM 102:
Bless the Lord, O my soul; blessed art Thou, O Lord.

Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me bless His holy name.

Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all that He hath done for thee,

Who is gracious unto all thine iniquities, Who healeth all thine infirmities,

Who redeemeth thy life from corruption, Who crowneth thee with mercy and compassion,

Who fulfilleth thy desire with good things; thy youth shall be renewed as the eagle’s.

The Lord performeth deeds of mercy, and executeth judgment for all them that are wronged. He hath made His ways known unto Moses, unto the sons of Israel the things that He hath willed.

Compassionate and merciful is the Lord, long-suffering and plenteous in mercy.

Not unto the end will He be angered, neither unto eternity will He be wroth. Not according to our iniquities hath He dealt with us, neither according to our sins hath He rewarded us.

For according to the height of heaven from the earth, the Lord hath made His mercy to prevail over them that fear Him.

As far as the east is from the west, so far hath He removed our iniquities from us.

Like as a father hath compassion upon His sons, so hath the Lord had compassion upon them that fear Him.

For He knoweth whereof we are made, He hath remembered that we are dust.

As for man, his days are as the grass; as a flower of the field, so shall he blossom forth.

For when the wind is passed over it, then it shall be gone, and no longer will it know the place thereof.

But the mercy of the Lord is from eternity, even unto eternity, upon them that fear Him.

And His righteousness is upon sons of sons, upon them that keep His testament and remember His commandments to do them.

The Lord in heaven hath prepared His throne, and His kingdom ruleth over all.

Bless the Lord, all ye His angels, mighty in strength, that perform His word, to hear the voice of His words.

Bless the Lord, all ye His hosts, His ministers that do His will.

Bless the Lord, all ye His works, in every place of His dominion.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.

Both now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.

Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless His holy name; blessed art Thou, O Lord.


<nb->In the parishes it is often the custom to chant only the following selected verses:</nb->

Bless the Lord, O my soul; blessed art Thou; O Lord.

Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me bless His holy name.

Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all that He hath done for thee.

Who is gracious unto all thine iniquities, Who healeth all thine infirmities.

Who redeemeth thy life from corruption, Who crowneth thee with mercy and compassion.

Who fulfilleth thy desire with good things; thy youth shall be renewed as the eagle’s.

Compassionate and merciful is the Lord, long-suffering and plenteous in mercy.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit;

Both now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.

Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me bless His holy name; blessed art Thou, Lord.


If it be a weekday simple service, and there be no directions in the Menaion concerning verses for the Beatitudes, then we may chant the Daily Antiphons:

## The First Daily Antiphon, Psalm 91:

Stichos 1:	It is good to give praise unto the Lord and to chant unto Thy name, O Most High.
Refrain:	Through the prayers of the Theotokos, O Saviour, save us.
Stichos 2:	To proclaim in the morning Thy mercy, and Thy truth by night. Refrain.
Stichos 3:	That upright is the Lord our God, and there is no unrighteousness in Him. Refrain.
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, both now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.


_Dn.(Pr.)_ Again and again, in peace let us pray to the Lord.

_Ch._ Lord, have mercy.

_Dn.(Pr.)_ Help us, save us, have mercy on us, and keep us, O God, by Thy grace.

_Ch._ Lord, have mercy.

_Dn.(Pr.)_ Calling to remembrance our most holy, most pure, most blessed, glorious Lady Theotokos and Ever-Virgin Mary with all the saints, let us commit ourselves and one another and all our life unto Christ our God.

_Ch._ To Thee, O Lord.

_Pr._ For Thine is the dominion, and Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory: of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and unto the ages of ages.

_Ch._ Amen.

## THE SECOND ANTIPHON, PSALM 145:
_Ch._ Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.

Praise the Lord, O my soul. I will praise the Lord in my life, I will chant unto my God for as long as I have my being.

Trust ye not in princes, in the sons of men, in whom there is no salvation.

His spirit shall go forth, and he shall return unto his earth. In that day all his thoughts shall perish.

Blessed is he of whom the God of Jacob is his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God,

Who hath made heaven and the earth, the sea and all that is therein,

Who keepeth truth unto eternity, Who executeth judgment for the wronged, Who giveth food unto the hungry.

The Lord looseth the fettered; the Lord maketh wise the blind; the Lord setteth aright the fallen; the Lord loveth the righteous;

The Lord preserveth the proselytes. He shall adopt for His own the orphan and widow, and the way of sinners shall He destroy.

The Lord shall be king unto eternity; thy God, O Sion, unto generation and generation.


<nb->Or if it be a simple service:</nb->

## The Second Daily Antiphon, Psalm 92:

Stichos 1: The Lord is King, He is clothed with majesty; the Lord is clothed with strength and He hath girt Himself.

Refrain: Through the prayers of Thy saints, O Saviour, save us.

Stichos 2: For He established the world which shall not be shaken. Refrain.

Stichos 3: Thy testimonies are made very sure. Holiness becometh Thy house, O Lord unto length of days. Refrain.


<nb->Then, regardless of which antiphon hath been chanted:</nb->

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, both now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.

O Only-begotten Son and Word of God, Who art immortal,* yet didst deign for our salvation* to be incarnate of the holy Theotokos and Ever-Virgin Mary,* and without change didst become man,* and wast crucified, O Christ God, trampling down death by death,* Thou Who art one of the Holy Trinity,* glorified with the Father and the Holy Spirit, save us.

_Dn.(Pr.)_ Again and again, in peace let us pray to the Lord.

_Ch._ Lord, have mercy.

_Dn.(Pr.)_ Help us, save us, have mercy on us, and keep us, O God, by Thy grace.

_Ch._ Lord, have mercy.

_Dn.(Pr.)_ Calling to remembrance our most holy, most pure, most blessed, glorious Lady Theotokos and Ever-Virgin Mary with all the saints, let us commit ourselves and one another and all our life unto Christ our God.

_Ch._ To Thee, O Lord.

_Pr._ For a good God art Thou, and the Lover of mankind, and unto Thee do we send up glory: to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and unto the ages of ages.

_Ch._ Amen.

<nb->And they chant:</nb->

## THE THIRD ANTIPHON, THE BEATITUDES:
In Thy kingdom remember us, O Lord, when Thou comest in Thy kingdom.

Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.

Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.

Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.

Blessed are they that are persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for My sake.

Rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in the heavens.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit;

Both now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.


<nb->Or if it be a simple service:</nb->

## The Third Daily Antiphon, Psalm 94:

Let not the communion of Thy holy Mysteries be unto me for judgment or condemnation, O Lord, but for healing of soul and body.

O Lord Who dost bless them that bless Thee and sanctify them that put their trust in Thee: Save Thy people and bless Thine inheritance; preserve the fullness of Thy Church, sanctify them that love the beauty of Thy house; do Thou glorify them by Thy divine power, and forsake us not that hope in Thee.
